        <h2>Understanding adolescent mental health</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Adolescence is a period of significant change. Shifts in mood, behavior, relationships, and academic
          performance are common, but sometimes these changes become particularly intense or persistent.
          Support can help teenagers and families navigate these transitions more safely and effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Common reasons families seek support include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Noticeable changes in mood, energy, or motivation</li>
          <li>Increased anxiety, worry, or irritability</li>
          <li>Withdrawal from friends, activities, or family members</li>
          <li>Academic stress, school avoidance, or declining performance</li>
          <li>Conflicts at home that feel difficult to resolve</li>
          <li>Challenges related to identity, peer relationships, or life transitions</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.95rem; color: #5f6368;">
          Seeking care does not mean that something is “wrong” with your teenager or your family. It reflects a
          proactive step toward understanding and support.

        <h2>How we work with teenagers</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Our clinicians aim to create a space where adolescents feel heard, respected, and not judged. We
          recognize that adolescents are at different stages of readiness to talk about their experiences, and
          we tailor our approach accordingly.

            <h3>Respectful, age-appropriate communication</h3>
            <p>
              We speak with adolescents in a way that acknowledges their perspective and developmental stage.
              We explain the purpose of sessions, what to expect, and how information will be used, so that the
              process feels as predictable as possible.

            <h3>Confidentiality and boundaries</h3>
            <p>
              We discuss confidentiality clearly with the adolescent and their caregivers at the beginning of
              care. We explain what information is kept private, and what must be shared for safety. When
              possible, we encourage adolescents to share important information with caregivers with our
              support.

              We use therapeutic approaches that have been shown to help with anxiety, mood concerns, and
              related difficulties in adolescents. Sessions may include learning coping strategies, practicing
              communication skills, and exploring thoughts and emotions in a structured way.

              professionals to support consistent care.

              caregivers. We gather information about current concerns, history, and goals for care. When
              appropriate, we may also meet separately with the adolescent and caregivers to better understand

              with the adolescent, family sessions, or a combination. We discuss the plan with all involved,

            <h3>Do parents or caregivers attend every session?</h3>
            <p>
              Not necessarily. In many cases, adolescents have individual sessions while caregivers participate
              in periodic check-ins or family sessions. The structure of care is discussed with all involved at
              the beginning of treatment and may be adjusted over time.

            <h3>Will I be informed about everything my teenager shares?</h3>
            <p>
              We maintain appropriate confidentiality to help adolescents feel able to speak openly. We also
              discuss with your teenager what information can be shared with caregivers and emphasize safety.
              If there are concerns about safety or risk, we will communicate these clearly and involve
              caregivers as needed.

            <h3>What if my teenager does not want to come?</h3>
            <p>
              It is common for adolescents to feel uncertain about starting counseling. We can offer guidance on
              how to introduce the idea and may suggest an initial meeting framed as an opportunity to ask
              questions rather than a commitment to long-term treatment.
