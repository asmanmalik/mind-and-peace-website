        <h2>Understanding anxiety and depression</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Anxiety and depression are common mental health conditions that can affect how you feel, think, and
          function. You might notice persistent worry, low mood, changes in sleep, difficulty concentrating,
          or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. These experiences can be distressing, but they
          are also treatable.
        </p>

        <h3>Some signs you may recognize include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Persistent worry, fear, or a sense of being “on edge”</li>
          <li>Ongoing sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness</li>
          <li>Changes in sleep, appetite, or energy</li>
          <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
          <li>Withdrawing from friends, family, or activities</li>
          <li>Feeling overwhelmed by daily responsibilities</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.95rem; color: #5f6368;">
          Not everyone experiences these conditions in the same way. Our role is to listen carefully and
          understand what these symptoms look like in your life.

          We provide structured, individualized treatment for anxiety and depression. Our clinicians draw on
          evidence-based therapies and, when appropriate, coordinated psychiatric care to help reduce symptoms
          and improve daily functioning.

            <p>
              We begin with a thorough evaluation of your symptoms, history, and goals. We consider medical,
              psychological, and social factors that may be contributing to what you are experiencing and

              We use therapeutic approaches that have been shown to help with anxiety and depression. Treatment
              may involve learning new skills for managing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, tailored to your

              We pay attention to sleep, stress, routines, relationships, and other aspects of daily life that
              affect mood and anxiety. We may suggest strategies to support healthy habits in a way that feels
              manageable instead of overwhelming.

              decisions are made collaboratively, with time for questions and ongoing monitoring.

            <p>
              Treatment length varies based on your goals, history, and response to care. Some individuals work
              with us for a few months, while others prefer longer-term support. We will discuss an initial

              No. Medication is one possible component of treatment, not a requirement. If medication is
              recommended, we will explain the reasoning and discuss your preferences. You are invited to ask
